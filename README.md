jQuery ScrollUp for WordPress
================

A small jQuery plugin that adds "to the top"-link in the bottom of the screen.

The plugin adds a small arrow to the bottom of the screen, and when the user clicks it the page automatically scrolls the user to the top of the screen. With a smooth animaton ofcourse. The arrow is only visible when the user has scrolled down the page, for maximum user experience.
